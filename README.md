<ul>About the project
    <li>The project is an implementation of tic-tac-toe game which is based on minimax algorithm</li>
    <li>Initially, the user is given an empty board. User is supposed to fill the game board with the relevant inputs. Three options are given as inputs 'e' / 'x' / 'o', where 'e' means empty</li>
    <li>After providing all the inputs the user is given with two buttons, 1)reset option - which will clear out all the inputs of the user 2) start option - which will start the game</li>
    <li>The game is played by two bots, turn by turn until they come to any one of the following conclusions 1) Draw 2)The first bot wins 3)The second bot wins </li>
    <li>The second user clicks on start button, a new page is displayed with board and a button, where, each bot's move is shown one after the other as the user clicks the button</li>
    <li>After they come to one of the conclusions, the button provided to the user will be automatically renamed to "return" and when it is clicked, it will redirect the user to the hoomepage</li>
</ul>

I have also attached a video of the output.
